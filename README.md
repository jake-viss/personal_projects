## 2.4.3 Test Repository
### Testing GitHub Repositories - LET'S GO.
---
*I will be using this repository to test a variety of Github features as well as writing a README file that contains text formatted with Markdown.*

**Let's be honest... this is a bold README file.**
---

*Let's look at some code snippets.*

```python
def nooby(me):
    if fintech_course_completion == true:
        print("Congrats Noob! You're no longer a noob!")
    else:
        print("RAGE QUIT")
```

>"...to boldly go where no one has gone before... I WILL ADD LINKS!
